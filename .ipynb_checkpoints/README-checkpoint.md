#Case description
First analyse the perception of the role of the women per country, as we have a generous quantity of relevant data that can tell the story about women in each country. This will lead to a broader analyze of the representation of women in top positions globally and examine how this representation influences socio-economic factors, human capital indices, and overall country development. 
The project also aims to address and fight common misconceptions about the role of women in society by providing data-driven insights.



#Goal:

In this EDA we are going to focus on the following questions:

Potential research questions:
1- Which countries have the highest and lowest representation of women in top positions?
2 - How does this compare with the overall percentage of women in the workforce and in STEM?
3 - Is there a correlation between GDP and the percentage of women in top positions?
4 - Are countries with higher education levels for women (especially in STEM) showing better gender diversity in leadership?
